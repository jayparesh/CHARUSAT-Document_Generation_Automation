**The hard parts made easy!**

This automation system automatically generates the practical file for you when supplied with the corresponding code, output and conclusion files. Perfect formatting guidelines are followed to generate the file!
You don't need to bother wasting few hours for formatting and making the file when it can be done via a click of button!

## System Requirements

- Windows OS
- Java 10 or higher

## Usage

1. Download the executable file for the software from the download link above.

2. Create a folder structure in the following format as an input to the software:
   
   - Create a main folder where all your files will be stored
   
   - Inside that folder create three more folders
        - code
        - output
        - conclusion  
         <br>
    - These folders would contain your code, output and concluion files respecitively.
        
    - Each file inside the folder follows a particular naming convention
           
        - code ``` prac + practical number + sub number```
        - output ``` output + practical number + sub number```
        - conclusion ``` conclusion + practical number```    
           <br>
    - Check example below to understand it properly  
    <br>
3. Run the application and click on upload folder and from the folder picker select the main folder you created in above steps.  

4. If the folder structure would be correct the document file would be generated in the same folder, else it should give you an error - recheck the folder strcuture and try again.

NOTE:
Start adding the practical files from the 2nd practical, the 1st one is already done for you!
The practicals are given numbering continuously, i.e different sections dont have numberings starting again from one.
(After section 1 is completed, continue numbering from 11 in section to, so on upto 42...)

There should be no practical missing in between for automation to take place
(Say you want to generate file till 24th practical, then all the files from 2nd practical to 24th practical must be present, no practical number in between should be missing)
```

```
NOTE:
The ID number in the header would be mine, you will need to change it to yours manually (this is a known bug for this release)

> In rare cases if your antivirus detects the exe file as a virus (which is false-positive, ofcourse!)

> Download [this](http://client.kushan.tech/charusat/2018/docGenAutomation/builds/04092018/DocumentGenerationAutomation.jar) Jar file and make sure you have JRE version 10 or higher before running it.
